# OAuth2.0IntegrationwithSpringBoot

I'm excited to share that I've successfully integrated Google OAuth 2.0 authentication in a Spring Boot application! ðŸŽ‰

OAuth 2.0 has become a standard for secure authentication and authorization, and with Spring Security, it's easier than ever to protect your web applications. In this project, I leveraged Spring Boot to build a seamless authentication flow using Google Sign-In, allowing users to authenticate via their Google account.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of this Integration:

Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication
Easy integration with Spring Security
Secure API access with token validation
Simple and efficient user login flow
This project not only helped me understand OAuth 2.0 better but also gave me hands-on experience with Spring Security and Spring Boot.
